# Basic Usage

This guide covers the essential commands and workflows for using VoiceKey.

## Starting VoiceKey

### From Command Line

```bash
# Start with interactive dashboard
voicekey start

# Start in background (tray mode)
voicekey start --daemon

# Start minimized to tray
voicekey start --minimized
```

### From System Tray

If you've set up auto-start, VoiceKey will start automatically in the system tray.

## Using VoiceKey

### Step 1: Activate Listening

Say the wake phrase: **"voice key"**

The tray icon will turn green, indicating VoiceKey is listening.

### Step 2: Speak Your Text

Speak naturally. VoiceKey will:

1. Convert your speech to text
2. Type the text into the active application

### Step 3: Use Commands (Optional)

End your command with "command":

```
"new line command" → Presses Enter
"control c command" → Presses Ctrl+C
```

### Step 4: Return to Standby

VoiceKey automatically returns to standby after:
- Wake window timeout (default 5 seconds of silence)
- Inactivity auto-pause (in toggle/continuous mode)

These commands work without the wake phrase:

| Command | Action |

### Keyboard Shortcuts
